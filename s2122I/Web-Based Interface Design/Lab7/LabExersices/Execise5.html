        Mr. Bean is a British sitcom created by Rowan Atkinson and Richard
        Curtis, produced by Tiger Aspect and starring Atkinson as the title
        character. The sitcom consists of 15 episodes that were co-written by
        Atkinson alongside Curtis and Robin Driscoll; for the pilot, it was
        co-written by Ben Elton. The series was originally broadcast on ITV,
        beginning with the pilot on 1 January 1990 and ending with "The Best
        Bits of Mr. Bean" on 15 December 1995.

        Based on a character originally developed by Atkinson while he was
        studying for his master's degree at Oxford University, the series
        centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as "a child in a grown man's
        body", as he solves various problems presented by everyday tasks and
        often causes disruption in the process. The series has been influenced
        by physical comedy actors such as Jacques Tati and those from early
        silent films.

        During its original five-year run, Mr. Bean met with widespread acclaim
        and attracted large television audiences. The series was viewed by 18.74
        million viewers for the episode "The Trouble with Mr. Bean". The series
        has also been sold in 245 territories worldwide and has inspired an
        animated spin-off and two theatrical feature-length films along with
        Atkinson reprising his role as Mr. Bean for a performance at the London
        2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, television commercials and
        several sketches for Comic Relief. Besides the acclaim of the show,
        another reason for the show's appeal in hundreds of territories
        worldwide is that the show uses very little intelligible dialogue,
        making it accessible to people who know little or no English.
