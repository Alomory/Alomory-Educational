        <h1>Awesome view - Batu Buruk Beach</h1>
        <p>
          "being there on 4/8/2017 with my friends. it's a beautiful beach and
          had an awesome viewing. There are 5 couple swings and also if not
          mistaken 3 single swings along the beach. I am being there on sunny
          day that make the view more amazing. It's really good for seaside
          walking and relaxing place. It also had street food and it's lively
          place on weekend.
