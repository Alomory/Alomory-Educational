            The Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (University of Malaysia,
            Terengganu) or UMT, formerly known as Kolej Universiti Sains dan
            Teknologi Malaysia (University College of Science and Technology
            Malaysia) or KUSTEM, is a university in Kuala Nerus District,
            Terengganu, Malaysia. It was officially chartered on 1 February
            2007.<br /><br />
            <strong>HISTORY</strong> of Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT)
            <br /><br />
            Universiti Malaysia Terengganu began as Universiti Pertanian
            Malaysia's Centre for Fisheries and Marine Science, located at
            Mengabang Telipot, Kuala Terengganu. It provided facilities for both
            students and lecturers from the Fisheries and Marine Science
            programmes to conduct their practical sessions and also researches.
            <br /><br />
            Eventually, the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science of
            Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) in Serdang was transferred to
            Kuala Terengganu, and the Centre transformed into a branch campus,
            being renamed Universiti Pertanian Malaysia Terengganu (UPMT) in
            June 1996. The name of the faculty was also changed to the Faculty
            of Applied Sciences and Technology. Also formed were the Faculty of
            Science and Professional Literature and the Matriculation Centre.
            <br /><br />
            Later on, the Cabinet of Malaysia had approved the establishment of
            Terengganu University College (KUT) on 5 May 1999 as an associate
            campus of UPM. Then Terengganu Universiti College was given autonomy
            on 1 May 2001 and was renamed the Malaysian Science and Technology
            University College (KUSTEM) on 20 June 2001. <br /><br />
            On 1 February 2007, KUSTEM was given the status of a full-fledged
            university, and with that elevation, it was renamed again and remain
            to this very day as Universiti Malaysia Terengganu.
